# Photo-Viewer

This was a project I completed in my final year of college in a web design class using HTML CSS and JavaScript.
It is a simple web app that allows users to view a collection of images from a local folder or a JSON file. It supports manual navigation between photos, automated slideshows, and random slideshows.

# It Features:
Load Images from Local Folder: Input folder name, common name, start and end photo numbers to load a batch of images.
Load Images from JSON: Load a set of photos from a JSON file URL.
Navigation: Go to the first, last, previous, or next photo.
Slideshows: Start an ordered or random slideshow of photos.
Reset Form: Reset input fields and image view without refreshing the page.
